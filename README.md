The xml2 package is a binding to [libxml2](http://xmlsoft.org), making it easy to work with HTML and XML from R. The API is somewhat inspired by [jQuery](https://jquery.com).

## Installation

You can install xml2 from CRAN, 

```R
install.packages("xml2")
```

or you can install the development version from github, using `devtools`:

```R
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("r-lib/xml2")
```

## Usage

```R
library("xml2")
x <- read_xml("<foo> <bar> text <baz/> </bar> </foo>")
x

xml_name(x)
xml_children(x)
xml_text(x)
xml_find_all(x, ".//baz")

h <- read_html("<html><p>Hi <b>!")
h
xml_name(h)
xml_text(h)
```

There are three key classes:

* `xml_node`: a single node in a document.

* `xml_doc`: the complete document. Acting on a document is usually the same 
  as acting on the root node of the document.

* `xml_nodeset`: a __set__ of nodes within the document. Operations on 
  `xml_nodeset`s are vectorised, apply the operation over each node in the set.

## Compared to the XML package

xml2 has similar goals to the XML package. The main differences are:

* xml2 takes care of memory management for you. It will automatically
  free the memory used by an XML document as soon as the last reference
  to it goes away.

* xml2 has a very simple class hierarchy so don't need to think about exactly 
  what type of object you have, xml2 will just do the right thing.

* More convenient handling of namespaces in Xpath expressions - see `xml_ns()` 
  and `xml_ns_strip()` to get started.
